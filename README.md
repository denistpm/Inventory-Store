Program for Inventory Management

This is my second project. I’ve been studying data science for about a month now, and this is actually my first assigned project. It’s quite similar to the previous one, but with different functionality. Currently, I’ve added an "Update Product" menu to the main menu.

The fucntion are 

1. Add products
2. Show the list of products
3. Update existing products information
4. Erase Products
5. Exit the program

This program is still far from perfect, so feel free to share any comments or suggestions to help improve it.
Thank you very much!
